## Problem Statement and Description

In today's fast-paced digital age, staying focused and productive can be a challenge due to numerous distractions available on various digital platforms. Additionally, maintaining a positive mood and managing stress during task execution can be difficult, leading to reduced productivity and overall well-being. Unfortunately, existing productivity tools often lack integrative features that promote both productivity and well-being simultaneously.

Our goal is to develop a web application that not only assists users in managing and tracking their tasks but also creates an engaging and soothing environment to enhance focus and mood. By leveraging AI and music streaming services, we aim to provide a unique solution that enhances user productivity, reduces stress, and contributes to overall well-being. Through this approach, we address the need for a more comprehensive and enjoyable productivity experience.
